## Description  
Nutshell Cashew is a group exercise in full CRUD with Firebase.  
Each member picked one page on a user dashboard--Diary, News, Events, or Messages-- and completed all the functionality for full CRUD for that page.  
Tasks such as authentication, user name creation on first login, dashboard landing/home page, seed data, styling, refactoring, and Readme were then divided among and completed by various group members.  
The project creates a user dashboard where the user can select a page, read their existing entries, add a new entry, edit and existing entry, or delete an existing entry.
